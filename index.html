                                    <strong>For Cause.</strong> FrontSight may immediately terminate the Services if
                                    FrontSight has reason
                                    to believe that (i) Client is attempting to disparage or defame FrontSight;
                                    expose FrontSight to legal liability; or otherwise act in a manner reasonably
                                    likely to harm FrontSight's business interest; (ii) Website development
                                    is made impracticable or is delayed for at least thirty (30) days as a
                                    result of Client's (a) failure to provide Client-provided Content
                                    or necessary feedback; or (b) failure to transfer a domain name or provide
                                    domain register's login credentials; (iii) threatened to file or filed
                                    a frivolous legal action against FrontSight (each "Termination for
                                    Cause"). If such breach cannot be cured or is not cured within thirty
                                    (30) days of written notice ("Cure Period"), FrontSight may immediately
                                    terminate the Agreement and/or pursue all other available remedies, including
                                    recovery from Client of FrontSights' costs and attorneys' fees incurred
                                    in pursuing such remedies (collectively "Termination Remedies").
                                    Suspension of Services due to breach shall not relieve Client of its obligation
                                    to pay the Charges incurred for the Services during suspension or otherwise.

                                    may terminate this Agreement if the other Party breaches any material
                                    term or condition of this Agreement ("Material Breach") and
                                    fails to cure such breach within five (5) days after receipt of written
                                    notice of the same, except in the case of delinquent payments for Services
                                    which must be paid in full no later than five (5) days after the Charge
                                    due date. Despite anything to the contrary, FrontSight may immediately suspend
                                    and/or pause (i) Client's Paid Search Campaign and/or Website if Client
                                    is ever one (1) day delinquent on a Charge; or (ii) any other Service
                                    if Client is more than five (5) days delinquent on a Charge. Either Party
                                    may terminate this Agreement with five (5) days notice if the other Party
                                    materially breaches the same material term or condition of this Agreement.

                                    checks, which may or may not create delinquent or past-due invoices, shall
                                    be a material breach, which may not be cured, where FrontSight may terminate

                                    <strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong> In the event of a Dispute, the Party raising the
                                    Dispute shall give written
                                    notice to the other Party setting forth the details of the Dispute and
                                    any proposed solution or compromise. The Parties shall cooperate in good

                                    <strong>Arbitration.</strong> If the Parties cannot resolve a Dispute, any and all
                                    Disputes (including,
                                    but not limited to, the validity of this agreement to arbitrate) will
                                    be settled exclusively by final and binding arbitration joining all of
                                    the claims asserted by or against the Parties in connection with such
                                    Dispute or claim. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County,
                                    California and shall be administered by JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive
                                    Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect except as limited or expanded
                                    by this Agreement. This clause shall not preclude Parties from seeking
                                    provisional remedies in aid of arbitration (e.g., to compel arbitration)
                                    or from seeking equitable or provisional relief from a court of competent
                                    jurisdiction. The Parties will jointly select one independent arbitrator
                                    who is experienced and knowledgeable about the internet marketing industry
                                    and about the particular products or services at issue and who is not
                                    an employee, consultant or former employee or consultant of either Party.
                                    If the Parties do not agree on the identity of the arbitrator within five
                                    (5) business days of the commencement of the arbitration, either Party
                                    may apply to JAMS for the appointment of an arbitrator who will have,
                                    to the greatest extent possible, experience and knowledge about the Internet
                                    marketing industry and about the particular products or services at issue.
                                    If required to act in accordance with this Section to appoint a single
                                    arbitrator in lieu of a Party, JAMS will appoint an arbitrator within
                                    fifteen (15) days of such application.

                                    or the United States, and further agree that the California State courts

                                    County, with venue in Los Angeles, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
                                    enforce the arbitrator's findings under this Agreement where FRONTSIGHT

                                    and will state with particularity the legal and factual bases for the

                                    <strong>Fees and Awards.</strong> The arbitrators' fees and costs of the arbitration
                                    will be borne by
                                    the Claimant and Respondent equally, unless the arbitrator in his discretion
                                    makes a different provision in the final award. The arbitrator is empowered
                                    in his discretion to include an award of costs, including reasonable attorneys'
                                    fees and disbursements to the prevailing Party. In addition to monetary
                                    damages, the arbitrator will be empowered to award equitable relief, including,
                                    but not limited to, an injunction and specific performance of any obligation
                                    under this Agreement. The arbitrator's award of damages shall be limited
                                    by the recited limitations and liabilities of this Agreement and any other
                                    relief, including suspension or termination, will be consistent with the
                                    terms and conditions of this Agreement. The arbitrator will have no jurisdiction
                                    to, and is not empowered to, modify or amend the exclusions and limitations
                                    of liability set forth in this Agreement. The arbitrator will be authorized
                                    in his discretion to grant pre- and post-award interest at commercial
                                    rates. Any costs, fees or taxes incident to enforcing the award will,
                                    to the maximum extent permitted by law, be charged against the Party resisting
                                    such enforcement. Judgment upon the award may be entered by any court
                                    in the United States having jurisdiction over the relevant Party or any
                                    of its assets.

                                    <strong>Relationship of Parties.</strong> FrontSight and Client are independent
                                    contractors. Neither Party is an agent,

                                    Client expressly authorizes FrontSight to enter into any agreements necessary
                                    to provide Services on Client's behalf. This Agreement does not, and
                                    is not intended to, confer any rights or remedies upon any person other
                                    than Client and FrontSight. Client acknowledges that FrontSight provides Services
                                    to other businesses throughout the world, and Client agrees that nothing
                                    herein grants Client an exclusive right to receive Services from FrontSight.
                                    Client agrees that FrontSight may provide Services to Client's potential
                                    or actual competitors, and such provision of Services does not give rise
                                    to a conflict of interest.

                                    which are merged in this Agreement. If any provision of these terms or
                                    incorporated documents is found by the arbitrator or a court of competent
                                    jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator
                                    or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions
                                    as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these terms
                                    remain in full force and effect. Except for claims by FrontSight relating

                                    may be made, nor action based upon such claim brought, by either Party
                                    more than one (1) year after the Agreement terminates.

                                    due during the Term, and Client agrees to inform FrontSight in writing if

                                    creates an electronic signature that has the same legal force and effect
                                    as a handwritten signature on a written contract under any applicable
                                    law or regulation, and is equally binding. By clicking on the "I

                                    (or its authorized agent) has the power, authority and legal right to

                                    <strong>Waiver; Survival.</strong> Should any provision of this Agreement be held
                                    void, invalid, unenforceable,
                                    or illegal by a court of law, the remaining provisions will remain valid
                                    and enforceable. Any of the provisions of this Agreement may be waived
                                    by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof. No Party will be deemed,
                                    by any act or omission, to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder
                                    unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the waiving Party, and
                                    then only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. A waiver
                                    with reference to one event will not be construed as continuing or as
                                    a bar to, or waiver of, any right or remedy as to a subsequent event.
                                    Any provisions of this Agreement which impose an obligation or right after
                                    the termination or expiration date shall survive the termination or expiration
                                    of this Agreement and shall be binding on the Parties, and Client expressly
                                    waives any statutory or other legal protection in conflict with these
                                    provisions.
